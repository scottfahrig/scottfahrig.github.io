# Going Back to Blogging
I’ve been thinking a lot lately about archival. Not just important moments or works of art, but seemingly everyday thoughts or ideas.

I just have a feeling that with so much of our daily focus and energy being poured into manufacturing polished, beautiful content, we might be forgetting to write down our real thoughts about the things that are actually happening around us in real time.

Besides, I can’t imagine that every thought Socrates had was all that important, but he had the foresight to write everything down anyway. So we were able to pull his good ideas out of the pile of bad.

Who knows if I’ll still be blogging by tomorrow. This could just be a manic episode.
