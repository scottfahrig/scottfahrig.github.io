This is the easiest and most accurate way I can think of to describe infinity:

### Everything Is Alive

At a big enough physical scale or time scale, every thing must be either alive or a part of a larger organism. For instance: our galaxy could be a blood cell in a universe, and that universe could be the brain of another organism, who could exist outside our universe in a larger gigaverse, which itself could be contained within the iris in the eyeball of some being in a higher dimension who could look like us, or really, in theory look EXACTLY like us. 

Mathematic infinity demands that not only are there infinite dimensions in which every possible version of a specific event takes place, there must also be infinite dimensions in which the events and moments play out exactly as you experienced them. nothing changed. And each version of the universes that do make even the smallest of changes *themselves* have infinite identical twin dimensions. 

If you can imagine that as a grid in four dimensions where each line of the grid is shifting, congratulations; I think that’s how you visualize a fourth physical dimension. 

These are just my silly thoughts. If you stumble upon this while doing homework or something please don’t cite this, as I am very very dumb.
